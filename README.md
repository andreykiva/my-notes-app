## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating the app's dynamic and responsive front-end.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, ensuring better code quality and reducing bugs.
- Electron: A framework for building cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- electron-forge: A tool for managing the Electron app's build and packaging process, streamlining the app's deployment.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app, making it easy to design and maintain a clean, responsive layout.
- Tiptap React: A rich-text editor for React, providing powerful features for editing content (such as lists, code, etc.) within notes.
- Vitest & React Testing Library: Tools for unit testing and ensuring the app‚Äôs components work as expected, with Vitest for fast test execution and React Testing Library for component-based tests.

## üß≠ Project Structure
Here's an overview of the main directories in the project:

- `src/electron`
Contains the Electron-specific code for building and running the desktop application. This folder includes the main process, which controls the app's lifecycle, window creation, and interactions with native operating system features.

- `src/renderer`
Holds the React front-end code (renderer process) of the application. This is where the UI and business logic are implemented, using React, TypeScript, and other libraries.

- `src/shared`
This folder contains shared utilities, types, and constants used across both the Electron and React (renderer) processes. This is useful for code reusability and ensuring consistency throughout the app.

- `src/__tests__`
Contains unit and integration tests for the project. The tests are written using Vitest and React Testing Library to ensure the components and functionality work as expected.
